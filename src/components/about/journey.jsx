            A Harvard MBA with nearly a decade of technical leadership in the
            Oil & Gas industry, I bring a distinctive blend of strategic
            expertise and creative vision to every endeavor. As co-owner of
            Iqballaz Customs, Houstonâ€™s premier car customization shop, I have
            cultivated a brand rooted in quality, innovation, and cultural
            richness. In 2025, I expanded my journey into digital storytelling,
            curating elevated travel and lifestyle content that resonates with a
            global, aspirational audience. Through a lens of authenticity and
            wanderlust, my platforms inspire others to find the extraordinary
            within the everyday and embrace the art of living well.
